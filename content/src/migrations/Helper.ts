/**
 * It is extremely hard to re-write history, so the idea is to delete all relevant history and re-deploy these deployments. We will only
 * do this if the affected deployments are mono-pointer. This is because handling deployments with multiple pointers is way harder.
 * We will:
 * - Take a list of pointers
 * - Check that all deployments in those pointers are mono-pointer
 * - Move these deployments to failed-deployments
 * - Delete these deployments from all other tables on the database
 *
 * Then, deployments should be manually 'fixed' and everything will go back to normal. Ideally, in the future there will be a way for the content
 * server to auto-fix its own failed deployments, but that has to be done manually for now.
