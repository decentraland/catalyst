Task to implement DB for control data

1) Split ContentStorage into 2 different interfaces
   - One for Content Data storage, to store the files containing the content data managed by the Content Server
   - One for Management Data storage, to store all the management and control data required to provide access to the former.

2) Avoid using the ContentStorage in the following *Storage objects:
   NamingStorage
   HistoryStorage
   PointerStorage
   FailedDeploymentsStorage
   AuditStorage
   DenylistStorage

3) Define what to do with:
   ServiceStorage: Is it still required?
   S3ContentStorage
   FileSystemContentStorage
