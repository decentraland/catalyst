# Catalyst Status

This project is a simple create-react-app that displays information about all the catalysts listed in the [DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#dcl.eth).

## What this does

- [x] List all users in comms, per realm
- [x] List all servers in a DAO
- [x] Allow user to use the denylist
- [x] List the latest users updated on a catalyst
- [x] List the latest scenes updated on a catalyst
- [x] Check the status of lambdas, comms & content services

## Wishlist

- [ ] Easier switch between catalysts
- [ ] More efficient lookups (many of the "latest" work with querying everything)
