# Automatic version bumping

## Following the convention

We use the [release Github action](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst/actions/workflows/release.yml) to release, which traverse the commits from the last tagged to the most recent one, and releases a new version bumping the current version depending on the keywords found in the commits' messages.

This is only possible if your commits follows the convention set in the [Git Style Guide](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-6-git-style-guide.md) which is based on [semantic commits](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages).

### Validation

 It is crucial to ensure that this convention is being embraced. There is a validation in the Github workflow that won't allow you to merge your pull request if its title doesn't follow it.

## Version bumping

This chart reflects which type of message bumps `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.

| type      | bumps |
| --------- | ----- |
| break     | major |
| feat      | minor |
| chore     | patch |
| docs      | patch |
| fix       | patch |
| refactor  | patch |
| revert    | patch |
| style     | patch |
| test      | patch |

## More than one type

While developing you will find yourself committing different types of changes so that your commit history could look like this:

```
docs: explain the feature
```
```
feat: add the feature
```
```
test: test the feature
```

What should my pr title be in this case? You should look at what is going to be bumped in the table above and give priority to `major`, then `minor`, and for last `patch`. So for this example, the pr title will look like this

```
feat: not neccesarily the same description as the commit's
```

If your commits are tied in terms of priority, for example, if you only have `docs`, `chore`, and `fix`, select the one that you feel it is more descriptive or more predominant.
